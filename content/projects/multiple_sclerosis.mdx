__Multiple Sclerosis (MS)__, a chronic and debilitating inflammatory autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system, afflicts approximately __900,000 people__ in the United States and __2.1 million people__ worldwide.

Because patients with MS typically have a long-life span and increased healthcare utilization, MS imposes a significant burden on patients and their families/caregivers, employers, and the healthcare system.

__Three questions to ask:__
1. What factors are significant in predicting MS?
2. Can we predict which patients are diagnosed with MS?
3. Is the out-of-pocket costs associated with MS?
