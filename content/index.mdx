Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in Data Science at [Bowling Green State University](https://www.bgsu.edu).
My research interests are in the areas of reinforcement learning, approximate dynamic programming, and Bayesian optimization.
I am also interested in a variety of application domains, such as energy markets, ride-sharing, and public health.
I received my [MS in Technology Management](https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/mstm) from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

# Interests

My research goal is to enhance our productivity and creativity in the writing process by leveraging Natural Language Processing techniques. From helping users type sentences faster, to inspiring writers to come up with something creative, to helping developers write code more easily, I am interested in the interaction between human and computer and how technology can aid humans to be better writers.
